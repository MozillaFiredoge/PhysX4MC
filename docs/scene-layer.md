# Scene/Object Layer

The scene/object layer is the lightweight boundary between Minecraft-facing code
and the raw physics backend.

It borrows the main idea from Sable's sublevel architecture: Minecraft gameplay
code should not directly own native physics handles. Unlike Sable's full
sublevel model, this layer does not yet provide isolated chunk grids, moving
block storage, client interpolation, or plot allocation.

## Current Scope

- `PhysicsSceneManager` owns server physics scenes by stable scene key.
- `ServerPhysicsScene` owns one `PhysicsWorld`.
- `PhysicsObject` is the Minecraft-facing handle for simulated objects.
- `PhysicsObjectId` is stable and suitable for future entity/network mapping.
- `PhysicsObjectSnapshot` captures pose, velocity, type, id, and closed state.
- `RigidPhysicsObject` wraps backend `PhysicsBody` and optional owned shape
  without exposing native handles.

## Current Object Types

- `STATIC_PLANE`
- `STATIC_BLOCK`
- `DYNAMIC_BOX`

These are deliberately narrow so the first Minecraft integration can focus on
server tick, entity synchronization, and simple full-block terrain collision
before richer terrain shape handling and moving structures.

## Lifecycle

Scene-level cleanup is authoritative:

```text
object.close()
scene.close()
manager.close()
```

Closing a scene closes all remaining objects and then closes its physics world.
Removing an object by `PhysicsObjectId` closes the object and removes it from the
scene index.

## Server Integration

`ServerPhysicsRuntime` owns the active server scenes. It creates scenes for
server levels, steps them from `ServerTickEvent.Post`, and closes them when the
server stops.

The current command surface is:

```text
/px4mc spawn_box
/px4mc set_velocity
/px4mc physics_status
/px4mc clear
```

`spawn_box` creates a visible `BlockDisplay` debug proxy bound to a dynamic
physics box and queues terrain chunks around the spawn point. The proxy binding
and terrain queue are owned by `ServerPhysicsRuntime`, not by the raw scene, so
the scene layer remains independent of Minecraft entity implementation details.

`set_velocity` applies a direct linear velocity override to the nearest dynamic
debug box in the current level.

`physics_status` prints native link status, scene count, object count, terrain
collider count, terrain chunk count, bound entity count, last step time, last
terrain build time, terrain queue state, dynamic box count, and a sample dynamic
object pose/velocity from the current level.

## Why Not Full Sublevels Yet

Full sublevels become useful when the mod needs moving block assemblies, local
chunk grids, serialization of internal block storage, bounds tracking, and client
render interpolation. The current target is smaller: a visible Minecraft entity
following a PhysX dynamic body. This scene layer gives that target a clean API
without committing to the full sublevel data model prematurely.
